# Fira Slav 4.0

FiraSlav is a monospaced font for Church Slavonic.

Editing Church Slavonic text in a text editor can be complicated because
stacking diacritical marks are difficult to visually identify and correct.
This font treats all diacritical marks and combining letters as spacing
symbols and maintains a monospaced appearance, ideal for text editing projects.
