## Note:\
\
All weights below \'94Thin\'93 use fractional coordinates which is an optical decision. Rendering engines might not be able to deal with that correctly. As for that, these weights should be seen as an experiment by now. If you notice any problems in smaller sizes please consider to use weights from thin.\
\
Weight \'94Ultra\'93 is intended for extreme display usage. It is the result of an extrapolation (198 to 222) which is not optimized in typographical details. Please consider to use \'84Heavy\'93 instead if problems occur.\
